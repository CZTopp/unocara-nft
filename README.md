This project was started by following this tutorial: https://dev.to/rounakbanik/writing-an-nft-collectible-smart-contract-2nh8

I add the eip2981 standard for royalties found here: https://github.com/dievardump/EIP2981-implementation

# NFT Collection Contract

This project demonstrates an nft contract that adds royalties.
Note: this is not a boilerplate.
Note: This is not a production ready contract. Use at your own risk.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CZTopp/unocara-nft
cd unocara-nft
npm install
```

Try running the tests:

```sh
npx hardhat test
```

```sh
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

try running the contract

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js --network localhost
```
